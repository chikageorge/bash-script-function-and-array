This mini project provide a comprehensive guide on organizing shell scripts using functions to automate the setup of EC2 instances and S3 buckets for DataWise Solutions. The tutorial begins by explaining the importance of functions for clarity and efficiency, demonstrating how to encapsulate logic such as checking script arguments, verifying AWS CLI installation, and validating AWS authentication environment variables. It details the syntax for defining functions, including descriptive naming and proper placement within the script. Examples illustrate refactoring code into functions like `check_num_of_args` and `activate_infra_environment`, emphasizing readability and logical flow. The guide also covers AWS profile configuration, highlighting the use of `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config` files for managing different environments (e.g., testing, production). Key commands like `command -v` for dependency checks and `-z` for variable validation are explained. By the end, the script is structured with functions called sequentially, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance. This approach aligns with real-world practices, making the script robust and adaptable for automating AWS infrastructure tasks.
